- Create a new local repository:
  mkdir sample-project
  cd sample-project
  git init

- Create initial project files:
  touch index.html

- Make the first commit:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

- Connect to GitHub:
  1. Create a repository on GitHub.
  2. Link the local repository to the GitHub repository:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main

- Create and switch to a new branch:
  git checkout -b feature/new-feature

- List branches:
  - Local branches: git branch
  - Remote branches: git branch -r
  - All branches: git branch -a

- Push a new branch to remote:
  git push -u origin feature/new-feature

- Create and modify files:
  echo "# Project Title" > README.md

- Stage and commit changes:
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Add README with project description"

- Merge changes from feature branch to main:
  1. Switch to the main branch and pull updates:
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
  2. Merge the feature branch:
     git merge feature/new-feature
     git push origin main

- Clean up merged branches:
  - Delete the local branch: git branch -d feature/new-feature
  - Delete the remote branch: git push origin --delete feature/new-feature

- Set up the project for version control and push it to GitHub:
  - Initialize a Git repository locally using git init.
  - Create a corresponding repository on GitHub.
  - Link the local repository to GitHub using git remote add origin.
  - Stage, commit, and push the initial changes to the main branch with git push -u origin main.

- Create, push, and manage branches effectively:
  - Use git checkout -b <branch-name> to create and switch to a new branch.
  - After making changes, stage and commit them. Push the branch using git push -u origin <branch-name>.
  - Use GitHubâ€™s pull request functionality for managing changes and reviews.

- Ensure feature branch changes are merged into the main branch:
  - Submit a pull request from the feature branch on GitHub.
  - After review, merge the changes into the main branch through GitHub.
  - Pull the updated main branch locally using git pull.

- Clean up unused branches locally and remotely:
  - Delete a local branch using git branch -d <branch-name>.
  - Remove the branch remotely using git push origin --delete <branch-name>.
